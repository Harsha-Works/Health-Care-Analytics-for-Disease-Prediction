# Health-Care-Analytics-for-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning-based healthcare analytics project focused on disease prediction using real-world medical data. The project involves data collection, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques to improve accuracy in forecasting diseases.

Key Highlights:
âœ… Data Collection & Processing â€“ Extracted and cleaned healthcare data from EHRs and public health databases (e.g., Kaggle).
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Used visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to uncover trends and insights.
âœ… Predictive Modeling â€“ Built machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) for disease forecasting.
âœ… Model Optimization â€“ Improved accuracy with fine-tuning techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and Bayesian optimization.
